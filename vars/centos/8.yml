# Since this role only supports Calico at the moment, CentOS 8 is actually
# not supported due to some kernel modules missing. In the future, as
# network plugins are added to this module, I'm hoping that having CentOS 8
# details in the role will become useful. For now, don't let the fact that
# this file exists fool you. CentOS 8 is not yet supported.
